I got the template from colorib and make the following changes in my side.

->I also worked on emails to subscribe to the newsletter.
->The data added to the register table added into the database.
->The data added in the contact table is treated as a customer review on the first page of the website, taken from the database.
->I made three different models for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, so that information on the menu page can be added from the database.
